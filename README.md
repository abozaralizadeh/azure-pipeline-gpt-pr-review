## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The extension uses a sophisticated LangGraph-based architecture:

```
PR Context ‚Üí Context Analysis ‚Üí File Review ‚Üí Security Scan ‚Üí Code Suggestions ‚Üí Final Assessment
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì              ‚Üì           ‚Üì              ‚Üì              ‚Üì
  Determine      Review Each    Security    Generate      Post Results   Task Result
  Review Need    File          Analysis    Suggestions    to Azure      & Summary
```

### Core Components

1. **Review Orchestrator**: Coordinates the entire review process
2. **LangGraph Agent**: Manages the reasoning flow and LLM interactions
3. **Azure DevOps Service**: Handles all Azure DevOps API interactions
4. **Review State Management**: Tracks review progress and maintains context

## üìã Prerequisites

### Azure OpenAI Setup
1. **Azure OpenAI Resource**: Create an Azure OpenAI resource in your Azure subscription
2. **Model Deployment**: Deploy a GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo model
3. **API Access**: Ensure your Azure DevOps pipeline has access to the Azure OpenAI endpoint

### Azure DevOps Configuration
1. **Build Service Permissions**: The build service needs permissions to:
   - Read repository content
   - Create and manage PR comments
   - Access PR details and changes

2. **Pipeline Variables**: Configure the following variables:
   - `azure_openai_endpoint`: Your Azure OpenAI endpoint URL
   - `azure_openai_api_key`: Your Azure OpenAI API key
   - `azure_openai_deployment_name`: Your model deployment name

## üöÄ Installation

### 1. Install the Extension
- Download the extension from the Azure DevOps marketplace
- Install it in your Azure DevOps organization

### 2. Add to Pipeline
Add the task to your Azure DevOps pipeline YAML:

```yaml
- task: GENAIADVANCEDPRREVIEWER@2
  inputs:
    azure_openai_endpoint: 'https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/'
    azure_openai_api_key: '$(AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY)'
    azure_openai_deployment_name: 'gpt-4'
    max_llm_calls: '100'
    review_threshold: '0.7'
    enable_code_suggestions: true
    enable_security_scanning: true
    support_self_signed_certificate: false
```

### 3. Configure Variables
Set up pipeline variables in Azure DevOps:

```yaml
variables:
  AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY: $(AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY)
```

## üîß How It Works

### 1. Context Analysis
The agent first analyzes the PR context to determine if a detailed review is necessary:
- PR title and description
- Changed files and scope
- Branch information
- Author and reviewer details

### 2. File-by-File Review
For each changed file, the agent:
- Retrieves file content and diff
- Performs comprehensive code analysis
- Identifies issues and improvements
- Generates specific suggestions

### 3. Security Analysis
When enabled, performs security scanning for:
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS and injection attacks
- Hardcoded secrets
- Insecure authentication patterns
- Input validation issues

### 4. Code Suggestions
Generates actionable improvements:
- Before/after code examples
- Performance optimizations
- Readability improvements
- Best practice recommendations

### 5. Final Assessment
Provides comprehensive review summary:
- Overall quality assessment
- Issue categorization and counts
- Approval recommendations
- Actionable next steps

## üìä Review Output

## üéØ Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Clear PR Descriptions**: Provide context about what the PR accomplishes
2. **Focused Changes**: Keep PRs focused on single concerns
3. **Test Coverage**: Include tests for new functionality
4. **Code Standards**: Follow your team's coding standards

### For Pipeline Administrators
1. **Resource Management**: Set appropriate `max_llm_calls` based on your needs
2. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust `review_threshold` based on team preferences
3. **Security Scanning**: Enable security scanning for production code
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor LLM usage and costs

### For Teams
1. **Review Culture**: Use the extension as a learning tool, not just a gate
2. **Feedback Integration**: Incorporate AI suggestions into team coding standards
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review and adjust configuration
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: Use AI insights to improve team coding practices

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Errors
- Verify Azure OpenAI API key is correct
- Ensure the key has access to the specified deployment
- Check if the key has expired

#### Permission Errors
- Verify build service has repository read access
- Ensure build service can create PR comments
- Check organization-level permissions

#### High LLM Usage
- Reduce `max_llm_calls` if hitting limits
- Adjust `review_threshold` to filter out low-confidence suggestions
- Consider disabling code suggestions for large PRs

#### Performance Issues
- Monitor Azure OpenAI service performance
- Check network connectivity to Azure OpenAI
- Consider using smaller models for faster responses

### Debug Information
The extension provides detailed logging:
- Configuration validation
- File processing progress
- LLM call tracking
- Error details and stack traces

### Verbose logging
You can enable verbose debug logs (shows LLM prompts and response previews) by setting the environment variable `ADVPR_VERBOSE=1`. The task manifest sets this by default for the packaged task, but you can override it in your pipeline or agent environment if you prefer quieter logs.

## üìà Performance & Cost

### LLM Call Optimization
- **Context Analysis**: 1-2 calls per PR
- **File Review**: 3-5 calls per file (depending on complexity)
- **Security Scan**: 1-2 calls per file
- **Code Suggestions**: 1-2 calls per file with issues
- **Final Assessment**: 1 call per PR

### Cost Considerations
- Monitor Azure OpenAI usage and costs
- Adjust `max_llm_calls` based on budget constraints
- Use appropriate model tiers for your needs
- Consider batch processing for large repositories

## üîÆ Future Enhancements
