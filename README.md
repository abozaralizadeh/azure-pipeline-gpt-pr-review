## 🏗️ Architecture

The extension orchestrates a structured review pipeline:

```
PR Context → Context Analysis → File Review → Security Scan → Code Suggestions → Final Assessment
     ↓              ↓              ↓           ↓              ↓              ↓
  Determine      Review Each    Security    Generate      Post Results   Task Result
  Review Need    File          Analysis    Suggestions    to Azure      & Summary
```

### Core Components

1. **Review Orchestrator**: Coordinates the entire review process
2. **LLM Orchestrator**: Manages the reasoning flow and LLM interactions
3. **Azure DevOps Service**: Handles all Azure DevOps API interactions
4. **Review State Management**: Tracks review progress and maintains context

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Azure OpenAI Setup
1. **Azure OpenAI Resource**: Create an Azure OpenAI resource in your Azure subscription
2. **Model Deployment**: Deploy a GPT-5-codex or an older model
3. **API Access**: Ensure your Azure DevOps pipeline has access to the Azure OpenAI endpoint
4. **Preview Models**: For GPT‑4.1/GPT‑5 deployments, use the latest preview API version (e.g., `2024-08-01-preview`) and enable the Responses API input.

### Azure DevOps Configuration
1. **Build Service Permissions**: The build service needs permissions to:
   - Read repository content
   - Create and manage PR comments
   - Access PR details and changes
   - Contribute to pull requests (Project Settings → Repos → Repositories → Security → select *\<ProjectName> Build Service* → grant **Contribute to pull requests**)

2. **Pipeline Variables**: Configure the following variables:
   - `azure_openai_endpoint`: Your Azure OpenAI endpoint URL
   - `azure_openai_api_key`: Your Azure OpenAI API key
   - `azure_openai_deployment_name`: Your model deployment name

3. **Expose the OAuth Token to the Job**  
   The extension posts inline comments via the pipeline’s OAuth token. Make sure scripts can access it:

   - **YAML pipelines**
     ```yaml
     steps:
     - checkout: self
       persistCredentials: true
     ```
   - **Classic editor** – enable **Allow scripts to access the OAuth token** in the Agent job properties.

4. **Endpoint Format Reminder**  
   Azure endpoints follow  
   `https://{resource}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{deployment}/responses?api-version={version}`.  
   Older GPT‑3.5/4 deployments that still require `/chat/completions` should keep using the legacy endpoint.

## 🚀 Installation

## 🔌 MCP Server Integration

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers let you plug repository-specific knowledge bases or business rules into the reviewer. Provide them as a JSON array via the `mcp_servers` input (typically using a multi-line string in YAML).

### YAML configuration example

```yaml
- task: GENAIADVANCEDPRREVIEWER@2
  inputs:
    azure_openai_endpoint: 'https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/'
    azure_openai_api_key: '$(AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY)'
    azure_openai_deployment_name: 'gpt-5-codex'
    mcp_servers: |
      [
        {
          "name": "repository-knowledge",
          "endpoint": "https://example.com/mcp/context",
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer $(MCP_TOKEN)"
          },
          "timeoutMs": 8000,
          "payloadTemplate": "{\"query\":\"best practices for {{file_path}}\",\"fileDiff\":\"{{file_diff}}\",\"pr\":\"{{pr_context}}\"}"
        }
      ]
```

### Supported fields
- `name` (required): Friendly identifier used in logs.
- `endpoint` (required): HTTP URL of the MCP server endpoint.
- `method`: HTTP method (`POST` by default).
- `headers`: Additional request headers (e.g., bearer tokens).
- `timeoutMs`: Request timeout in milliseconds (defaults to 10s).
- `payloadTemplate`: Optional JSON template string. The agent replaces placeholders like `{{file_path}}`, `{{file_diff}}`, `{{file_content}}`, `{{pr_context}}`, and `{{metadata}}` before sending the request. When omitted, a default payload containing the diff, file content, and PR metadata is used.

### Response expectations
- Plain strings are treated as context items.
- JSON arrays should contain strings or objects with a `text` property.
- JSON objects can return `context`, `contexts`, `content`, or `summary` fields (strings or string arrays).
- Non-parsable responses are captured as raw text, ensuring the reviewer still receives the additional context.

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Context Analysis
The agent first analyzes the PR context to determine if a detailed review is necessary:
- PR title and description
- Changed files and scope
- Branch information
- Author and reviewer details

### 2. File-by-File Review
For each changed file, the agent:
- Retrieves file content and diff
- Performs comprehensive code analysis
- Identifies issues and improvements
- Generates specific suggestions

### 3. Security Analysis
When enabled, performs security scanning for:
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS and injection attacks
- Hardcoded secrets
- Insecure authentication patterns
- Input validation issues

### 4. Code Suggestions
Generates actionable improvements:
- Before/after code examples
- Performance optimizations
- Readability improvements
- Best practice recommendations

### 5. Final Assessment
Provides comprehensive review summary:
- Overall quality assessment
- Issue categorization and counts
- Approval recommendations
- Actionable next steps

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Clear PR Descriptions**: Provide context about what the PR accomplishes
2. **Focused Changes**: Keep PRs focused on single concerns
3. **Test Coverage**: Include tests for new functionality
4. **Code Standards**: Follow your team's coding standards

### For Pipeline Administrators
1. **Resource Management**: Set appropriate `max_llm_calls` based on your needs
2. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust `review_threshold` based on team preferences
3. **Security Scanning**: Enable security scanning for production code
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor LLM usage and costs
5. **OAuth Token Access**: Confirm `persistCredentials: true` (or the classic “Allow scripts to access the OAuth token” toggle) so the reviewer can post PR comments.

### For Teams
1. **Review Culture**: Use the extension as a learning tool, not just a gate
2. **Feedback Integration**: Incorporate AI suggestions into team coding standards
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review and adjust configuration
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: Use AI insights to improve team coding practices

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Errors
- Verify Azure OpenAI API key is correct
- Ensure the key has access to the specified deployment
- Check if the key has expired

#### Permission Errors
- Verify build service has repository read access
- Ensure build service can create PR comments
- Check organization-level permissions

#### High LLM Usage
- Reduce `max_llm_calls` if hitting limits
- Adjust `review_threshold` to filter out low-confidence suggestions

#### Comments Not Highlighting Diff Lines
- Ensure the PR branch contains actual line modifications (not whitespace-only changes)
- Check pipeline logs for `🔧 Built fallback unified diff` messages—these confirm the reviewer successfully reconstructed diff hunks
- Verify the Azure DevOps build service has permission to call the PR diff APIs (`pullRequests/{id}/changes`, `diffs/commits`)

#### Azure OpenAI 400 Bad Request
- GPT-4.1/GPT-5 deployments require newer API versions (e.g., `2024-08-01-preview`) — set the `azure_openai_api_version` input accordingly
- Enable the `azure_openai_use_responses_api` flag for models that only support the Responses API
- Review the task logs for the exact error body — it will be surfaced when the request fails
- Consider disabling code suggestions for large PRs

#### Performance Issues
- Monitor Azure OpenAI service performance
- Check network connectivity to Azure OpenAI
- Consider using smaller models for faster responses

### Debug Information
The extension provides detailed logging:
- Configuration validation
- File processing progress
- LLM call tracking
- Error details and stack traces

### Verbose logging
You can enable verbose debug logs (shows LLM prompts and response previews) by setting the environment variable `ADVPR_VERBOSE=1`. The task manifest sets this by default for the packaged task, but you can override it in your pipeline or agent environment if you prefer quieter logs.

## 📈 Performance & Cost

### LLM Call Optimization
- **Context Analysis**: 1-2 calls per PR
- **File Review**: 3-5 calls per file (depending on complexity)
- **Security Scan**: 1-2 calls per file
- **Code Suggestions**: 1-2 calls per file with issues
- **Final Assessment**: 1 call per PR

### Cost Considerations
- Monitor Azure OpenAI usage and costs
- Adjust `max_llm_calls` based on budget constraints
- Use appropriate model tiers for your needs
- Consider batch processing for large repositories
